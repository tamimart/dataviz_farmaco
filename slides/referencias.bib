   abstract = {Reports highlighting the problems with the standard practice of using bar graphs to show continuous data have prompted many journals to adopt new visualization policies. These policies encourage authors to avoid bar graphs and use graphics that show the data distribution; however, they provide little guidance on how to effectively display data. We conducted a systematic review of studies published in top peripheral vascular disease journals to determine what types of figures are used, and to assess the prevalence of suboptimal data visualization practices. Among papers with data figures, 47.7% of papers used bar graphs to present continuous data. This primer provides a detailed overview of strategies for addressing this issue by (1) outlining strategies for selecting the correct type of figure depending on the study design, sample size, and the type of variable; (2) examining techniques for making effective dot plots, box plots, and violin plots; and (3) illustrating how to avoid sending mixed messages by aligning the figure structure with the study design and statistical analysis. We also present solutions to other common problems identified in the systematic review. Resources include a list of free tools and templates that authors can use to create more informative figures and an online simulator that illustrates why summary statistics are meaningful only when there are enough data to summarize. Last, we consider steps that investigators can take to improve figures in the scientific literature.},

  abstract  = "The neurogenic theory of depression proposes that chronic
               medications modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission may
               ameliorate symptoms of mood disorders by correcting
               stressor-induced disruptions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
               However, some controversial findings challenge this assertion. A
               systematic review and meta-analysis of all pertinent studies,
               corrected by publication bias, estimated a small, significant,
               and consistent pro-neurogenic effect of monoaminergic treatments
               in laboratory rodents. Nearly 30\% of the literature exhibited
               low and 70\% unclear risk of bias. In both na{\"\i}ve and
               stressed mice, pro-neurogenic effects occurred irrespective of
               strain, sex, stress, or behavioral testing experience. In rats,
               the effects were predominantly inconclusive due to the lower
               number of studies in this species. The available number of
               studies was also insufficient to yield definitive evidence for
               compounds acting as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
               (citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine),
               serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (desvenlafaxine,
               duloxetine, venlafaxine), multimodal monoaminergic modulators
               (imipramine, desipramine), melatonergic compound (agomelatine),
               or norepinephrine-serotonin disinhibitory (mirtazapine).
               Subsequent updates of these reviews appear necessary to
               establish robust evidence regarding these compounds. Evidence
               was firm in favor of a robust pro-neurogenic effect of selective
               serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, in both species, making
               updates of this review probably redundant.",
